This is for epicodus reviewers:

This was a ridiculous amount of work to try to get done in one day at this stage in our learning.  I did as much as I could.  I'm still unclear about difference between get, post, and patch etc. and when and how to use one over the other. I don't think you've explained that very well up to this point.
